Raspberry PI4B

Chip:
    CPU: BCM2711
        Quad-core CPU. ARM A72 (ARM V8), 64-bit 1.5GHZ
        32kb data + 48kb instruction L1 cache per core
    GPU: VideoCore VI
        32-bit GPU

Addresses
    1. issued as virtual addresses by arm core
    2. mapped into a physical address by the arm mmu
    3. used to select appropriate peripheral or location in RAM

    Full 35-bit address map (maps to 4gb of ram)
        seen by large address masters. (DMA4 engines, ARM CPU)
    two l2 cache alias (one allocating, one non-allocating) which cache only first 1gb of SDRAM

    Physical Addresses
        start at 0x0_0000_0000
        ARM section starts at 0x0_0000_0000 and extends up to size of installed sdram
        VC section is 0x0_4000_0000 downwards

    Software accessing peripherals use 32-bit legacy addresses
